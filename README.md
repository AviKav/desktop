# Desktop 

Building native-like Elixir apps for Window, MacOS, Linux, iOS and Android using Phoenix LiveView!

## Changes in 1.2

- Removed the bleeding edge notices because Erlang OTP 24 is now broadly available for Windows/Linux/MacOS
- Added build support for iOS devices
- Moved most phoenix dependencies out to allow using Phoenix 1.6 / esbuild
